MAC OS X PACKAGING INSTRUCTIONS

1) Make sure you have the prereqs. If you don't, you will be prompted for them, but here they are for convenience:
    "cadnano2" path refers to the git source root
	a) Qt (library-only binaries, Cocoa, no debug symbols) from
	   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x
	   as of August 1, 2011 this file is:
	   http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.7.3.dmg
	b) SIP (put the OSX .tar.gz in cadnano2/install/osx) from
	   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
	c) PyQt (put the OSX .tar.gz in cadnano2/install/osx) from
	   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
2) Run "sudo python build_pkg.py" from the cadnano2/installer/osx folder. It needs root to install the SIP that it builds before it builds PyQt.
3) With luck, there is no 3, and a freshly minted cadnano2.pkg is sitting in the cadnano2/installer/osx folder.



CUSTOMIZATION

Many of the configurable aspects of OSX installer packages can be modified by changing files in the InstallerResources folder (which gets copied to cadnano2.pkg/Resources on package build). For instance, cadnano2/install/osx/InstallerResources/postflight gets copied to cadnano2.pkg/Contents/Resources/postflight, a magic location where Installer.app knows to look to run a postflight script. You will also find the License and Readme files in there that get displayed in the first stages of the installation process.
