MAC OS X PACKAGING INSTRUCTIONS

1) Make sure you have the prereqs. If you don't, you will be prompted for them, but here they are for convenience:
    "cadnano2" path refers to the git source root
	a) Qt (library-only binaries, Cocoa, no debug symbols) from
	   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x
	   as of August 1, 2011 this file is:
	   http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.7.3.dmg
	b) SIP (put the OSX .tar.gz in cadnano2/install/osx) from
	   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download
	c) PyQt (put the OSX .tar.gz in cadnano2/install/osx) from
	   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
2) Run "python build_pkg.py" from the cadnano2/installer/osx folder.



OLD MAC OS X PACKAGING INSTRUCTIONS (new = using build_pkg.py)

1) Switch to the official binary distribution of Qt obtained from the official
   site at
   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x
   (use `where qmake` and make sure that /usr/bin/qmake is on top)

2) Delete all Qt frameworks (/Library/Frameworks/Qt*) that aren't being used by
   cadnano. Use ActivityMonitor.app's list of open files for a process to
   quickly determine which frameworks are being used.

3) Download the latest release of PyQt from
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
   and build the source as usual (`python configure.py && make`)

4) Create the installation root, say ~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot
   and `make install DESTDIR=~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot` PyQt4 into it.

5) Copy /Library/Frameworks/Qt* into CadnanoInstallRoot/Library/Frameworks
   (~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot/Library/Frameworks/Qt* should now exist)

6) Open osx/cadnano2.xcodeproj, change the build style to "Release" (upper left)
   and build. Now osx/build/Release/cadnano2.app should exist. Copy it into
   ~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot/Applications (which you should create).

7) sudo chown -R root:admin ~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot

8) Open osx/cadnano-installer-template, delete everything beneath "Contents"
   sourcelist (left side of the window, blue background). Then drag
   ~/Desktop/CadnanoInstallRoot into the list.

9) Make sure the following are set correctly (select CadnanoInstallRoot):
   Configuration > Package Identifier = org.cadnano.allinonepkg
   Configuration > Package Version = 2.0b6 or something
   Configuration > Allow custom location = Not checked
   Components > cadnano2.app > Allow Downgrade = Checked
   Components > cadnano2.app > Allow Relocation = Not checked

10) Press Build (in PackageMaker.app) and save the freshly created .pkg
